# MathDimensions
A repository for code bits about everything involving dimensions. Do what you please.
All code has been made in Unity version 2022.3.19f1.
The executables are for Windows.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
-for the python programs, just install python and run it there.
-for the unity c# projects, if you want to try them out unzip everything and run the .exe file. The source code is also included, you don't need to unzip it for the program to run.

About the quaternion code, what it does (and what makes it interesting) is that it takes the points of the cube's mesh and does the quaternion
calculations to rotate it, no unity built-in stuff. You can see how it was made inside the code.
All credit to HackerPoet for Engine4D, with which I have made the little 4D demo game.
